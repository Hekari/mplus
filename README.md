This is a Website for my friend's company. I took it on myself to have some sort of "challange" and help my friend as well.

My main focus during the creation process was the website to be responsive and having good UX on every device as well as the Web performance should be a little better if 
I've added minimalized version of css/js, so that's the thing I'd change in future.

Technology used:

-JavaScript

-RWD(mobile first design)

-SCSS

-HTML
